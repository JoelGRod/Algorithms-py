    LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest 
    subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that 
    appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. 
    For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are 
    subsequences of “abcdefg”.

    It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff (a file 
    comparison program that outputs the differences between two files), 
    and has applications in bioinformatics.
