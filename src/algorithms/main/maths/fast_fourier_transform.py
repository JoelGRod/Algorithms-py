    FFT - computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, 
    or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its 
    original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the 
    frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a 
    sequence of values into components of different frequencies.

    Greedy - approximation / Brute force Algorithm
