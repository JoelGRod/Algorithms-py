     K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero 
     vectors of an inner product space. It is defined to equal the cosine 
     of the angle between them, which is also the same as the inner 
     product of the same vectors normalized to both have length 1.
