""" Bellman Ford - O(VE)
    Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths 
    from src to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain 
    negative weight edges. 

    For:
        Directed graph
        Weighted graphs
        Non-cyclic graphs

    Dynamic Programming:
        Multidimensional array
        Each cell -> data you want to improve
        Each cell -> Sub Problem
